# Stone-Paper-and-Scissors
# This code implements a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using the Tkinter library in Python. The program creates a graphical user interface (GUI) where a player can choose to play "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" against a computer opponent, which randomly selects its choice. The game displays the outcome of each round and allows the player to reset the game. The code provides an interactive game where a user can play against a computer with a simple GUI. The player's choice and the computer's random choice are compared to determine the winner for each round, and the user can reset the game at any time.
